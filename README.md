3. Fields of food:
	1. fillingness - specifies how filling food item is for organism
	2. for-human? - specifies (t/f) if food item if for human

	1. outfit 
2. Additional fields for door:
	1. locked? -specifies (t/f) if door is loced
	2. hole - specifies color of hole, used to compare to color of key so that door can be unlocked appropriately


## Procedures
1. new-food - creates a new food object. 
2. new-utensil - creates a new utensil object. 
3. new-key - creates a new key object. 
4. new-clothing - creates a new clothing object. 
5. new-animal - creates a new animal object . 
6. new-bag - creates a new bag object. 
7. new-phone - creates a new phone object . 
8. outfit - creates a new food object. 

## Methods
1. Methods for organism:
	1. feed - checks if organism can eat the thing, if so then it is removed from location and fullness of organism is updated
	2. can-eat? - checks if the input object is appropriate for the particular organism to eat, returns t/f
2. Methods for animal:
	1. pet - when called, prints animal's reaction to being pet, based on the friendliness field of animal. Also, increases the friendliness of the animal 
	by adding one and multiplying by two. 
3. Methods for clothing:
	1. don -  Puts on a clothing item; checks if clothing item is already being worn, otherwise, the clothing item is moved onto the person. 
  
	2. doff - Takes of clothing item; checks if item of clothing is not being worn, otherwise, removes the clothing item off of the person. 
4. Methods for phone:
	1. check-weather - prints the outside weather
	2. check-time - prints the time for the first appointment of the day
	3. check-temperature - prints the temperature outside. 
5. Methods for bag:
	1. zipOpen-bag - Opens bag (Doesn't count toward requirement total, added in list for clarity)
	2. zipClose-bag - closes bag (Doesn't count toward requirement total, added in list for clarity)
	3. putIn-bag - Checks if bag is open, Checks if bag has reached the capacity limit, if not, adds thing to the bag's contents
	4. takeOut-bag - checks if bag is already opened, then takes thing out of bag

1. Additional methods for door:
	1. unlock - unlocks door
2. Additional methods for person:
	1. can-eat? - checks if a person has all the items necessary to consume the food item. For example, if the food needs a spoon to be eaten,
	method checks if a spoon is in the person's contents.

Goals
Say a few words about what you wanted the game to be like.  Note that if you just wanted to write some code so you could get an good grade on the project, it’s fine to admit that.

Our goal was to simulate waking up in the morning, going through a typical morning routine, and then leaving for the day. The idea of the game was to successfully leave the house after completing all the necessary tasks like dressing up, engaing with pets, feeding yourself, and putting stuff in your bag. 


Lessons learned
What went right?

- We were able to break our program down into smaller pieces, code those small parts one by one and use inheritance effectively, which taught us
the benefits of objected-oriented programming. 



What went wrong?

- We originally wanted to create an environment that had more conditions and had an actual win/lose component with a timer, but decided after we started that 
it was too ambitious, and scaled back our approach. 





What do you wish you knew when you started?

-It was confusing at first to understand the relationship between all the types (inheritance).
